        </ol>
        Start with avoid network-threats I would recommend them to run their site on a trusted hosting-provider and protect their site with Cloudflare, this will also reflect positive on their website performance. 
        Implementation of automatic user timeout
        Using the default XSS protection if the site is made with React and creating integrity checks on external scripts.
        I would recommend the potential client to start with enabling 2FA authentication for users on the website.
        When finised setting up the web security practices, I would run through a check for vulnerablilities in dependencies.
